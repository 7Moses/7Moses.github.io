## the un-curated public spaces 20190208

The un-curated public spaces of NYC where people can gather, move to the outside, find a Somewhereness,

Of course, Somewhereness will always survive, existing on the edge of an Island, the margins, and the interstitial spaces of A City.  

Out there finding Space is likely a sense created by the nearby people.  

In Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx, there are uncurated public spaces, where people can gather. By moving to the outside, these spaces offer a unique sense of Somewhereness. This feeling will always survive on the edge of the island, in the margins, and in the spaces in between. Finding these spaces is likely guided by the presence of the nearby people.
